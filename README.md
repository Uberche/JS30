# Javascript 30
[https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/)

I have been working through Wes Bos's Javascript 30 course as it is a great refresher on all that ES6 brought us. 

### Status

19/30 days. Got distracted by a million other things. Coming back now that I have more time.

## Overview and Thoughts

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to start using JavaScript beyond the simple adding and removing of classes.
