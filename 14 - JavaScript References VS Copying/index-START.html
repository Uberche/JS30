    // let dog = "Cooper";
    // let coolestDog = dog;
    // console.log(dog, coolestDog); // Cooper, Cooper
    // dog = "Coop";
    // console.log(dog, coolestDog); // Cooper, Coop
    // coolestDog = dog;
    // console.log(dog, coolestDog); // Coop, Coop

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    // console.log(team, players);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = "lux";
    // console.log(team, players); // Both Lux

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; // Coming soon
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
